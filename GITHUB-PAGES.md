# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment - FIXED

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your PWA had path issues because GitHub Pages serves from a subdirectory. I've fixed:

1. ✅ Service worker path: `/service-worker.js` → `./service-worker.js`
2. ✅ Manifest paths: All `/` paths changed to `./` (relative)
3. ✅ Icon paths: Updated to relative paths
4. ✅ Icons generated: `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` created
5. ✅ Meta tag warning: Added `mobile-web-app-capable`

## 📦 Files Ready to Deploy

All files in this folder are now ready for GitHub Pages:

```
✓ index.html
✓ manifest.json
✓ service-worker.js
✓ icon-192.png
✓ icon-512.png
✓ README.md
✓ QUICKSTART.md
✓ package.json
✓ .gitignore
```

## 🔄 Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Push Updated Files

```bash
# If you haven't initialized git yet
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Fix PWA paths for GitHub Pages"

# If you haven't added remote yet
git remote add origin https://github.com/kthdrgn/ePub-Reader.git

# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to your repo: https://github.com/kthdrgn/ePub-Reader
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** / (root)
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub will build and deploy (takes 1-2 minutes)
- Check Actions tab for deployment status
- Your site: https://kthdrgn.github.io/ePub-Reader/

## 🧪 Test Your PWA

Once deployed, open https://kthdrgn.github.io/ePub-Reader/ and:

### Check Console (F12)
Should see:
```
✓ Service Worker registered successfully
```

Should NOT see:
```
❌ 404 errors
❌ Service Worker registration failed
```

### Check Application Tab
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Application
2. **Manifest**: Should show app name, icons
3. **Service Workers**: Should show "activated and running"
4. **Cache Storage**: Should have cached files

### Test Offline
1. Load the page once
2. DevTools → Network → Offline checkbox
3. Refresh page → Should still work!

### Install PWA
- Chrome: Look for ⊕ icon in address bar
- Mobile: "Add to Home Screen" banner

## ❗ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Still seeing 404 errors

**Solution 1**: Clear browser cache
- DevTools → Application → Clear storage → Clear site data
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

**Solution 2**: Wait for GitHub Pages cache
- GitHub Pages caches content
- Wait 5-10 minutes and try again
- Or add `?v=1` to URL to bust cache

**Solution 3**: Check file paths
```bash
# Ensure these files exist in your repo root
ls -la
# Should see:
# index.html
# manifest.json
# service-worker.js
# icon-192.png
# icon-512.png
```

### Issue: Icons not showing

**Fix**: Icons are now included! Just push them:
```bash
git add icon-192.png icon-512.png
git commit -m "Add PWA icons"
git push
```

### Issue: CORS policy errors (Google OAuth)

These warnings are normal and can be ignored:
```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.opener call.
```

They don't affect functionality. Google APIs work fine despite the warning.

### Issue: Service worker won't register locally

**Solution**: Use HTTPS or localhost
```bash
# Local testing requires a server:
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ What Should Work:
- Service worker registers successfully
- Icons appear in manifest
- App installs on devices
- Offline mode works
- No 404 errors in console

### ⚠️ Known Warnings (Safe to Ignore):
- Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy warnings (Google OAuth)
- Some browsers may show PWA score warnings in Lighthouse

## 🔍 Debug Checklist

If something isn't working:

1. ✅ All files pushed to GitHub?
   ```bash
   git status  # Should be clean
   git push    # Push any uncommitted files
   ```

2. ✅ GitHub Pages enabled?
   - Check Settings → Pages
   - Should show: "Your site is published at..."

3. ✅ Using correct URL?
   - ✅ https://kthdrgn.github.io/ePub-Reader/
   - ❌ https://kthdrgn.github.io/ (wrong)

4. ✅ Hard refresh browser?
   - Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
   - Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

5. ✅ Clear browser cache?
   - DevTools → Application → Clear storage

## 📱 Mobile Installation

### Android (Chrome)
1. Open https://kthdrgn.github.io/ePub-Reader/
2. Tap menu → "Install app" or use banner
3. App appears on home screen

### iOS (Safari)
1. Open https://kthdrgn.github.io/ePub-Reader/
2. Tap Share → "Add to Home Screen"
3. App appears on home screen

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Service worker "activated and running"
- ✅ Install button/banner appears
- ✅ Works offline after first load
- ✅ Icons show in manifest
- ✅ Can install to home screen

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the GitHub Actions tab** for deployment errors
2. **View deployment log** to see if all files were deployed
3. **Try incognito/private mode** to rule out cache issues
4. **Check browser compatibility**:
   - Chrome/Edge 90+ (best)
   - Safari 14+ (good)
   - Firefox 90+ (good)

## 📊 Lighthouse PWA Score

After deployment, test with Lighthouse:
1. DevTools → Lighthouse
2. Select "Progressive Web App"
3. Run audit
4. Should score 90+ (100 is possible!)
