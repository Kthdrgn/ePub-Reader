# 🔐 Google Drive Persistent Login - Fixed!

## ✅ Good News: Login Now Stays Persistent!

I've improved the authentication handling so you **stay signed in** across app sessions!

---

## 🔑 How It Works Now

### What Changed

**Before:**
- ❌ Had to sign in every time
- ❌ Token wasn't being used properly

**After (Fixed):**
- ✅ Sign in once per device
- ✅ Token saved automatically
- ✅ Auto-refreshes when needed
- ✅ Stays signed in even after closing app

---

## 📱 Quick Start

### First Time Setup

1. Open your EPUB Reader PWA
2. Click **☰ Menu** → **Sync with Drive**
3. Configure API credentials (if needed)
4. Click **Upload Library** or **Download Library**
5. Sign in when prompted
6. ✅ **Done! You're signed in permanently**

### Next Time You Use the App

1. Open the app
2. Click Sync
3. ✅ **Already signed in!**
4. Sync happens immediately

---

## 🔍 Check If You're Signed In

Open **☰ Menu** → **Sync with Drive**

Look for:
```
Authentication
✓ Signed in (stays signed in)
[Sign Out]
```

If you see this, you're authenticated and won't need to sign in again!

---

## ⏱️ Token Duration

- **Validity**: 1 hour (auto-refreshed)
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Persistence**: Survives app/browser restarts
- **Security**: Google OAuth 2.0

---

## 🔄 Auto-Refresh

The app automatically:
- Checks if your token is valid
- Uses saved token if still good
- Refreshes silently if expired
- Only prompts for login if refresh fails

---

## 💡 What You'll See

### In Console (F12)

**When using saved token:**
```
✓ Restored saved Google Drive authentication
✓ Using saved Google Drive token
```

**When getting new token:**
```
Requesting new Google Drive token...
✓ New Google Drive token obtained and saved
```

---

## 🚪 Sign Out

If you want to sign out:

1. **☰ Menu** → **Sync with Drive**
2. Click **Sign Out** button (red)
3. Confirm
4. ✅ Authentication cleared

Use this on:
- Shared computers
- Public devices
- When switching Google accounts

## 📊 When You Need to Sign In Again

| Scenario | Need to Sign In? |
|----------|------------------|
| First time using app | ✅ Yes |
| Opening app next day | ❌ No |
| After browser restart | ❌ No |
| After device reboot | ❌ No |
| Cleared browser data | ✅ Yes |
| Clicked "Sign Out" | ✅ Yes |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still Asking for Sign In?

**Possible causes:**

1. **Incognito/Private Mode**
   - Storage cleared when window closes
   - Fix: Use regular browser mode

2. **Browser Clearing Storage**
   - Check privacy settings
   - Fix: Allow site data to persist

3. **Privacy Extensions**
   - Some extensions clear localStorage
   - Fix: Whitelist your PWA domain

4. **Manual Data Clearing**
   - Fix: Don't clear site data for your PWA

### Verify Token is Saved

Open Console (F12):
```javascript
// Check token
localStorage.getItem('gdrive_access_token')

// Check expiry
new Date(parseInt(localStorage.getItem('gdrive_token_expiry'))).toLocaleString()
```

If these show values, your token is saved!

---

## 🔐 Security

### What's Stored

```
localStorage:
├── gdrive_access_token    // OAuth token (expires in 1hr)
├── gdrive_token_expiry    // When token expires
├── gdrive_client_id       // Your API credentials
├── gdrive_api_key         // Your API key
└── gdrive_sync_file_id    // Sync file reference
```

### Is This Safe?

✅ **Yes!** This is standard OAuth:
- Industry standard security
- Tokens expire automatically
- Scoped permissions only
- Same method Gmail uses
- No passwords stored
- Can be cleared anytime

---

## ⚙️ Auto-Sync Feature

With persistent login, auto-sync works perfectly:

1. Enable **Auto-Sync** in sync menu
2. App syncs every 5 minutes automatically
3. No sign-in prompts!
4. Silent background sync
